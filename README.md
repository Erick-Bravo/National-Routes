## Introduction

National Routes is a clone of [GoodReads](http://goodreads.com) to support hikers and travelers love for nature in the United States. It will allow users to see what National Park is in their neck of the woods and create their own routes for future visits. Once they're done, they can rate and review that experience in their own personal travel diary.
